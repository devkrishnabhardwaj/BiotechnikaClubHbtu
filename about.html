            Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU), Kanpur, formerly known as HBTI, was
            established in 1921 and has a rich history of contributing to technological
            advancements and industrial growth in India. Initially named the Government
            Technological Institute, it was renamed in 1926 in honor of Sir Spencer Harcourt
            Butler, then Governor of Uttar Pradesh. The university began offering degree
            courses in Oil Technology in 1921, followed by Chemical Engineering in 1954, and
            currently HBTU comprises four schools offering 13 B.Tech., 11 M.Tech., MCA, MBA,
            M.Sc. in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, and Ph.D. programs. On March 26,
            1965, it became an autonomous institution, and on September 1, 2016, it was
            upgraded to a university by the Government of Uttar Pradesh. The university
            spans two campuses—East Campus (77 acres) and West Campus (271 acres)—
            located about 3 kilometers apart. HBTU provides a supportive environment for
            the overall development of its students.
